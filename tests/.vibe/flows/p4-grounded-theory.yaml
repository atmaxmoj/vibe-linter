name: Grounded Theory
description: Coding loop, saturation/not-saturated 2-way, not-saturated goes back to collection

steps:
  # ── Data Collection ──

  - 1.1 Collect initial data

  # ── Coding Loop ──

  - 2.0 Coding loop:
      iterate: "coding_rounds"
      children:
        - 2.1 Open coding
        - 2.2 Axial coding
        - 2.3 Selective coding
        - 2.4 Saturation check:
            next:
              - if: "theoretical saturation reached"
                go: 2.0 Coding loop
              - go: 1.1 Collect initial data

  # ── Theory ──

  - 3.1 Write theory

  - 3.2 Theory review:
      type: wait
      next:
        - if: "theory is well-grounded"
          go: Done
        - go: 2.0 Coding loop

  - Done:
      type: terminate
      reason: Grounded theory complete
