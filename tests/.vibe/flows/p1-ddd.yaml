description: Domain-Driven Design — loop with inner wait for each bounded context review, 3-way fallback

steps:
  # ── Strategic Design ──

  - 1.1 Identify bounded contexts

  - 1.2 Define ubiquitous language

  # ── Context Implementation Loop ──

  - 2.0 Context loop:
      iterate: "bounded_contexts"
      children:
        - 2.1 Design aggregates and entities
        - 2.2 Implement domain model
        - 2.3 Write domain tests
        - 2.4 Context review:
            type: wait
            next:
              - if: "context implementation is approved"
                go: 2.0 Context loop
              - if: "needs minor fixes"
                go: 2.2 Implement domain model
              - go: 2.1 Design aggregates and entities

  # ── Integration ──

  - 3.1 Integrate bounded contexts

  - 3.2 Integration testing

  - 3.3 Final review:
      next:
        - if: "integration is solid"
          go: Done
        - go: 2.0 Context loop

  - Done:
      type: terminate
      reason: All bounded contexts integrated
