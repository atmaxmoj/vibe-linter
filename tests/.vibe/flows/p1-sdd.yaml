description: Spec-Driven Development — Spec as source of truth, phase loop, 3-way compliance check

steps:
  # ── Spec Definition ──

  - 1.1 Write specification:
      type: wait

  - 1.2 Generate implementation plan

  - 1.3 Plan review:
      type: wait
      next:
        - if: "plan is approved"
          go: 2.0 Phase loop
        - go: 1.2 Generate implementation plan

  # ── Phase Loop ──

  - 2.0 Phase loop:
      iterate: "phases"
      children:
        - 2.1 Implement phase
        - 2.2 Run phase tests
        - 2.3 Compliance check:
            next:
              - if: "implementation conforms to spec"
                go: 2.0 Phase loop
              - if: "implementation does not conform, code needs fixes"
                go: 2.1 Implement phase
              - if: "spec itself has issues"
                go: 1.1 Write specification

  # ── Integration ──

  - 3.1 Integration testing

  - 3.2 Final verification:
      next:
        - if: "all phases conform to spec"
          go: Done
        - go: 2.0 Phase loop

  - Done:
      type: terminate
      reason: All phases conform to specification
