名称: Risk-Based Testing
描述: Risk loop, 3-way (high-risk wait/medium-low record/no defect), loop with inner wait

步骤:
  # ── Risk Assessment ──

  - 1.1 Identify risks

  - 1.2 Prioritize by severity

  # ── Risk Loop ──

  - 2.0 Risk loop:
      遍历: "risks"
      子步骤:
        - 2.1 Design risk test
        - 2.2 Execute test
        - 2.3 Evaluate result:
            下一步:
              - 如果: "high severity defect found"
                去: 2.4 Wait for fix
              - 如果: "medium or low defect found"
                去: 2.5 Record defect
              - 去: 2.0 Risk loop
        - 2.4 Wait for fix:
            类型: wait
            下一步: 2.2 Execute test
        - 2.5 Record defect

  # ── Report ──

  - 3.1 Risk test report

  - Done:
      类型: terminate
      原因: Risk-based testing complete
