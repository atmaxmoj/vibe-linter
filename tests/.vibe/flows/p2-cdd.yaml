steps:
  # ── Planning ──

  - 1.1 Break page into components

  # ── Component Loop ──

  - 2.0 Component loop:
      iterate: "components"
      children:
        - 2.1 Implement component
        - 2.2 Write component tests
        - 2.3 Visual check:
            next:
              - if: "component looks correct visually"
                go: 2.0 Component loop
              - go: 2.1 Implement component

  # ── Integration & PR ──

  - 3.1 Compose page from components

  - 3.2 End-to-end testing

  - 3.3 PR review:
      type: wait
      next:
        - if: "PR approved"
          go: Done
        - go: 2.0 Component loop

  - Done:
      type: terminate
      reason: All components built and PR approved
