名称: Event-Driven Architecture
描述: Event loop, 3-way (success/retry/redesign), cross-phase fallback to definition

步骤:
  # ── Event Definition ──

  - 1.1 Define event schema

  - 1.2 Design event flow

  # ── Event Loop ──

  - 2.0 Event loop:
      遍历: "events"
      子步骤:
        - 2.1 Implement event handler
        - 2.2 Test event processing
        - 2.3 Event result:
            下一步:
              - 如果: "event processes successfully"
                去: 2.0 Event loop
              - 如果: "event lost or failed, needs retry logic"
                去: 2.1 Implement event handler
              - 如果: "event design is fundamentally flawed"
                去: 1.1 Define event schema

  # ── End-to-End ──

  - 3.1 End-to-end event flow test:
      下一步:
        - 如果: "all events flow correctly end to end"
          去: Done
        - 去: 2.0 Event loop

  - Done:
      类型: terminate
      原因: Event-driven architecture verified
