name: Event-Driven Architecture
description: Event loop, 3-way (success/retry/redesign), cross-phase fallback to definition

steps:
  # ── Event Definition ──

  - 1.1 Define event schema

  - 1.2 Design event flow

  # ── Event Loop ──

  - 2.0 Event loop:
      iterate: "events"
      children:
        - 2.1 Implement event handler
        - 2.2 Test event processing
        - 2.3 Event result:
            next:
              - if: "event processes successfully"
                go: 2.0 Event loop
              - if: "event lost or failed, needs retry logic"
                go: 2.1 Implement event handler
              - if: "event design is fundamentally flawed"
                go: 1.1 Define event schema

  # ── End-to-End ──

  - 3.1 End-to-end event flow test:
      next:
        - if: "all events flow correctly end to end"
          go: Done
        - go: 2.0 Event loop

  - Done:
      type: terminate
      reason: Event-driven architecture verified
