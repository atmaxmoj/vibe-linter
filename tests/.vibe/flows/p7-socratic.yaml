description: Nested loops — question loop containing sub-question loop, conditional entry into inner loop

steps:
  # ── Setup ──

  - 1.1 Define topic

  - 1.2 Formulate initial questions

  # ── Question Loop ──

  - 2.0 Question loop:
      iterate: "questions"
      children:
        - 2.1 Explore question
        - 2.2 Need deeper exploration?:
            next:
              - if: "question is fully understood"
                go: 2.0 Question loop
              - go: 2.0.1 Sub-question loop
        - 2.0.1 Sub-question loop:
            iterate: "sub_questions"
            children:
              - 2.3 Explore sub-question
              - 2.4 Sub-question resolved?:
                  next:
                    - if: "sub-question resolved"
                      go: 2.0.1 Sub-question loop
                    - go: 2.3 Explore sub-question

  # ── Synthesis ──

  - 3.1 Synthesize understanding

  - 3.2 Create knowledge map

  - Done:
      type: terminate
      reason: Socratic exploration complete
