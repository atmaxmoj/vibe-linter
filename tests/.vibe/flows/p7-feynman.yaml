name: Feynman Technique
description: Concept loop, clear 2-way (yes next/no study more), retry pattern

steps:
  # ── Setup ──

  - 1.1 Choose topic

  - 1.2 List concepts to learn

  # ── Concept Loop ──

  - 2.0 Concept loop:
      iterate: "concepts"
      children:
        - 2.1 Study concept
        - 2.2 Explain in simple terms
        - 2.3 Clear enough?:
            next:
              - if: "explanation is clear and complete"
                go: 2.0 Concept loop
              - go: 2.1 Study concept

  # ── Summary ──

  - 3.1 Create summary notes

  - Done:
      type: terminate
      reason: All concepts understood
