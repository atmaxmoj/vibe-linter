## Vibe Linter

This project uses vibe-linter for workflow management. When working on tasks:

1. Check current workflow status using the `vibe_get_status` MCP tool
2. Submit work output using `vibe_submit_output` when a step is complete
3. Follow the edit policies — some files may be restricted during certain steps
4. Use `vibe_get_context` to understand the current task requirements
