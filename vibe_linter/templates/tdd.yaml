名称: TDD Development
描述: Test-Driven Development workflow - Red, Green, Refactor

步骤:
  # ── Scenario Collection ──
  - 0.1 Collect scenario:
      下一步:
        - 如果: "has bug description or feature request"
          去: 1.1 Gather requirements
        - 去: 0.1 Collect scenario

  # ── Design Phase ──
  - 1.1 Gather requirements:
      下一步:
        - 如果: "this is a hotfix with known root cause"
          去: 2.1 Write failing test (Red)
        - 去: 1.2 Design architecture

  - 1.2 Design architecture

  - 1.3 Design review:
      下一步:
        - 如果: "design is approved"
          去: 2.0 Feature loop
        - 去: 1.2 Design architecture

  # ── TDD Feature Loop ──
  - 2.0 Feature loop:
      遍历: "features"
      子步骤:
        - 2.1 Write failing test (Red)
        - 2.2 Write minimal code (Green)
        - 2.3 Refactor
        - 2.4 Run test suite
        - 2.5 Quality check:
            下一步:
              - 如果: "all tests pass and code quality is good"
                去: 2.0 Feature loop
              - 如果: "tests fail due to code bugs"
                去: 2.2 Write minimal code (Green)
              - 如果: "tests themselves are wrong"
                去: 2.1 Write failing test (Red)
              - 如果: "design flaw discovered"
                去: 1.2 Design architecture

  # ── Integration ──
  - 3.1 Integration testing

  - 3.2 Final review:
      下一步:
        - 如果: "all integration tests pass"
          去: Done
        - 去: 2.0 Feature loop

  - Done:
      类型: terminate
      原因: All features implemented and tests pass
